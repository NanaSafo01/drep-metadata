    "comment": "As Wada DRep, we continue to support the development of a resilient and decentralized Cardano ecosystem through investments in infrastructure that embody transparency, neutrality, and technical rigor. In line with our earlier “yes” vote on the Amaru Node budget proposal, we have voted yes on the Amaru Treasury Withdrawal request for ₳1.5 million ADA, submitted under PRAGMA’s administration.\n\nThis withdrawal represents the execution phase of a community-approved budget and is entirely consistent with both the Cardano Constitution and the community’s strategic priorities. The proposal aligns with the ₳350M Net Change Limit and meets all the relevant constitutional standards for fund administration, including the use of smart contracts, milestone oversight, and metadata traceability.\n\nWhat makes this request particularly strong is its granular scope-based structure, which divides the full ₳1.5M into five individually managed allocations corresponding to the core development scopes: ledger, consensus, middleware (“mercenaries”), marketing, and contingency reserve. Each scope is overseen by a designated maintainer, drawn from highly respected Cardano-aligned organizations such as Blink Labs, dcSpark, Cardano Foundation, Sundae Labs, and TxPipe. The presence of named scope owners managing separate on-chain treasuries, each with clearly defined FTE estimates and budgets, creates a level of accountability and transparency that far exceeds minimum expectations.\n\nWe are also encouraged by the proposal’s technically robust treasury architecture. The team has adopted a smart contract solution originally designed and audited by Sundae Labs for Intersect. While their customized extension is still under audit, they have chosen to temporarily use the fully audited base version for the initial disbursement, a responsible interim step that prioritizes security and continuity. Additionally, metadata tracking using CIP-100 and off-chain audit logs would support financial oversight and simplify third-party auditing.\n\nBeyond the technical and procedural soundness, we believe that this proposal reflects Cardano’s values in substance. By developing a second, Rust-based block-producing node for Cardano, Amaru enhances node diversity, developer accessibility, and modular infrastructure, while lowering hardware barriers for participation. It also upholds neutrality by ensuring that contributors are not tied to any single founding entity and that the Cardano community itself becomes the project's ultimate stakeholder.\n\nWe further recognize the importance of avoiding mission drift. Amaru’s contributors are already compensated via existing funding (e.g., employment, sponsorships), and this withdrawal focuses strictly on uncovered resources, ensuring there is no duplication of funding. This level of fiscal clarity is commendable and contributes to our confidence in the withdrawal’s necessity and proportionality.\n\nIn conclusion, this treasury withdrawal exemplifies the kind of infrastructure investment that should be encouraged under Cardano’s governance model: mission-aligned, constitutionally compliant, operationally prepared, and community-accountable. For these reasons, we have voted yes on the Amaru Treasury Withdrawal request. We look forward to seeing this funding unlock the next phase of progress for one of the most strategically valuable technical initiatives in the ecosystem.\n"
