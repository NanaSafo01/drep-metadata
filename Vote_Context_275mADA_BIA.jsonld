    "comment": "As Wada DRep, we represent a decentralized and globally connected network of Cardano community builders, innovators, and voters; many based across Africa and the diaspora. Our role in constitutional governance is to act in the best interests of the ecosystem while reflecting the priorities of our community and honoring our internal deliberative frameworks.\n\nWe have voted YES on the proposal titled “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget – 275M ADA Administered by Intersect.” This proposal marks a historic step in Cardano’s transition to decentralized governance under the Voltaire era. It represents the culmination of months of community signaling, deliberation, and alignment, bringing together a comprehensive, community-approved set of proposals under a single, well-coordinated treasury framework.\n\nWe voted yes because this proposal honors the will of the Cardano community and adheres to the Constitution in both form and spirit. The ₳275.3M budget aggregates 39 community-vetted proposals, each of which surpassed the DRep support threshold (>50%) during the final temperature check via Ekklesia. These proposals represent a wide spectrum of Cardano’s ecosystem needs, from core development, research, and open-source tooling to governance infrastructure, community funding mechanisms, and global outreach.\n\nImportantly, we at Wada had already reviewed and supported the majority of these proposals during our internal budget evaluation process, guided by an internal treasury ceiling of ₳280 million ADA. Supporting this unified budget is therefore not just consistent but a continuation of the signal we already gave through careful review and strategic endorsement of impactful proposals. Voting yes on this aggregate proposal aligns with our previous evaluations and respects the structure and intent of the wider community budget process.\n\nWe are especially aligned with the proposal’s administrative design. Intersect’s role as the designated administrator is backed by a constitutionally compliant, smart contract–based fund management system. This includes milestone-gated disbursements, due diligence checks (KYC/KYB), audit and pause-payment mechanisms, and multi-signature oversight involving independent stakeholders. These controls are exactly what is needed to model responsible treasury stewardship in Cardano’s first constitutional budget cycle. The presence of these safeguards gives us confidence that Treasury funds will be managed transparently and only released in accordance with project performance and community expectations.\n\nBy voting yes, we are affirming the legitimacy of community-led budget formation. This proposal represents the most coordinated and participatory budget process in Cardano’s history and deserves our support as a model for future funding cycles. Additionally, we recognize and endorse the competence of Intersect to oversee fund disbursement with transparency and accountability. The organization has demonstrated its readiness to fulfill the role of administrator in alignment with the Cardano Constitution and community interest.\n\nThis vote also signals our belief that Cardano’s governance system is ready to support proposals from both founding and non-founding entities in a fair, strategic, and verifiable manner. A robust ecosystem must be built on inclusion, legitimacy, and capacity, not on legacy position alone. We believe this proposal successfully integrates contributions from across the community in a way that reflects that principle.\n\nFinally, this vote is a signal to our fellow DReps and community members: we must not fragment our governance process with redundant or competing budget actions. The strength of this proposal lies in its cohesion, as it consolidates a wide array of high-quality proposals under a single, unified administrative track. That clarity and coordination will be essential for maintaining legitimacy and trust as we operationalize decentralized budgeting at scale.\n\nFor these reasons, we, the Wada DRep, voted YES on the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget Administered by Intersect. We see it as both a milestone in governance maturity and a foundation for the community to build upon in future funding cycles.\n"
