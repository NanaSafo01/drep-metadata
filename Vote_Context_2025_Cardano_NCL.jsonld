    "comment": "As Wada DRep, we represent a decentralized and globally connected network of Cardano community builders, innovators, and voters; many based across Africa and the diaspora. Our role in constitutional governance is to act in the best interests of the ecosystem while reflecting the priorities of our community and honoring our internal deliberative frameworks.\n\nWe have voted NO on the 200 million ADA Net Change Limit (NCL) proposal currently under consideration. Our rationale is grounded in the fiscal framework we adopted during the budget evaluation cycle, the governance signals already sent by the broader Cardano community, and the practical needs of delivering on our shared roadmap.\n\nAs part of our internal governance process, the Wada DRep committee adopted a 280 million ADA Net Change Limit as the basis for evaluating and voting on funding proposals submitted in the 2025 budget round. This figure was selected to strike a responsible balance, well below the community’s maximum cap of 350M ADA, yet sufficient to support high-impact projects advancing the ecosystem.\nThe vast majority of the proposals we supported under this internal framework are now bundled within the Intersect-administered ₳275.3M aggregate budget. Voting \"yes\" on a new 200M NCL would directly undermine the logic and consistency of our internal budgeting decisions, calling into question the integrity of the structured assessment we undertook with our community.\n\nThrough a robust, DRep-led signaling process, the Cardano community has already approved more than 275 million ADA in funding proposals, all of which passed the required threshold of 50%+1 Lovelace in live DRep stake. These proposals span core development, governance infrastructure, marketing, community empowerment, open-source tooling, and more.\nReducing the NCL to 200M ADA now would effectively block full or timely disbursement of many of these already-approved initiatives. We believe it is a governance failure to approve a project and then retroactively impose fiscal constraints that prevent its execution.\n\nThis is the first full year of decentralized, constitutional governance in Cardano. A Net Change Limit is intended to serve as a safeguard and not as a restrictive ceiling that stifles the very processes it was meant to enable. Approving only 200M ADA for 2025 would risk starving essential components of Cardano’s governance experiment: constitutional oversight, DRep operations, auditing frameworks, and the infrastructure required to make Voltaire viable.\nWe believe a stronger test of governance maturity is not whether we spend less but whether we spend wisely and deliver results. Artificially suppressing funding capacity may delay the development of tools and insights we need to evolve the governance model.\n\nWe acknowledge and appreciate the fiscal caution motivating the 200M proposal. However, we believe that caution is better reflected in the ongoing proposal to establish a 300M ADA NCL for Epochs 563–635, which extends into 2026. That figure is more aligned with expected treasury inflows and allows for continuity of funding without encouraging excess.\nIn contrast, the 200M proposal feels disconnected from both the scale of approved budgets and the trajectory of Cardano’s growth. Rather than help us build a robust treasury governance culture, it may erode confidence in the predictability and reliability of the on-chain funding process.\n\nOur vote of \"No\" on the 200M ADA NCL proposal is not a vote against caution; it is a vote for coherence, credibility, and continuity. It reflects our obligation as a DRep to act in alignment with the budgeting framework we adopted, to defend the legitimacy of Cardano governance, and to preserve trust in the roadmap we are collectively building.\n\nCardano’s governance needs to be accountable, but also functional. That means setting limits that are anchored in realistic funding needs and in the will of the community and not overly restrictive thresholds that ignore context and hamstring delivery.\n\nFor all these reasons, we, the Wada DRep, have voted NO.\nLet us govern boldly and wisely.\n"
