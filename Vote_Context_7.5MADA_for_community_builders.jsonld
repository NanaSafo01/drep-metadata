    "comment": "As Wada DRep, we represent a decentralized and globally connected network of Cardano community builders, innovators, and voters, many based across Africa and the diaspora. Our role in constitutional governance is to act in the best interests of the ecosystem while reflecting the priorities of our community and honoring our internal deliberative frameworks.\n\nWhile we deeply value the intentions behind the proposal titled “2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget – ₳7.5M for Community Builders,” we have made the decision to abstain from voting on this Budget Info Action. Our abstention is not a reflection of disagreement with the proposals listed. On the contrary, we voted “Yes” on each of these individual projects during the community review phase and maintained strong support for their impact and alignment with Cardano’s long-term vision.\n\nHowever, we must also act in a way that preserves clarity and coordination within Cardano’s treasury governance process. All of the individual proposals bundled in this ₳7.5M package also appear in the larger ₳275.3M aggregate budget proposal administered by Intersect, titled “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget – 275M ADA Administered by Intersect.” That proposal includes the same community-approved projects, has passed DRep signaling, and has been carefully structured to align with treasury guardrails, milestone management, and transparent disbursement practices.\n\nAs such, casting a “yes” vote on both Budget Info Actions creates a risk of administrative and treasury access conflict if both are passed. There is no clearly defined resolution process for managing overlapping budget actions that authorize separate administrators for the same set of proposals. In this context, a dual approval may create confusion around which administrative pathway—Intersect’s structured oversight framework or an alternate, undefined one—should take precedence.\n\nOur abstention reflects our desire to avoid contributing to that ambiguity while still honoring our prior support for these proposals. We continue to recognize and affirm the tremendous contributions of the community builders represented in this budget. However, we believe that the best path forward is to endorse a single, unified administration for the 2025 budget cycle, specifically, Intersect, which we have already decided to support in the broader ₳275.3M proposal.\n\nWe encourage our fellow DReps to consider the importance of administrative consistency and treasury process integrity when casting their votes on overlapping Budget Info Actions.\n"
