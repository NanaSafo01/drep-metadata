    "comment": "We, the Wada DRep Committee, have voted yes on the governance action to replace the Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC) with the newly elected Constitutional Committee (CC), in accordance with Article VII of the Cardano Constitution. This marks a pivotal and positive transition from a founding, appointed body to a community-elected institution that reflects Cardano’s commitment to decentralized governance.\n\nThroughout the May–July 2025 election process, we evaluated each candidate and cast yes votes for several of the candidates who were ultimately elected to serve. As such, we have no hesitation endorsing this final ratification and are confident that the committee reflects a diversity of perspectives, strong governance orientation, and constitutional literacy. We see our support for this governance action as a natural extension of our earlier DRep-level endorsement of these candidates during the election phase.\n\nWe are also reassured by the transparent and inclusive design of the election, the integrity of the vote auditing process, and the use of staggered term lengths that preserve continuity while initiating rotation. The carryover of some experienced ICC members into the new CC strengthens institutional memory while reinforcing democratic legitimacy.\n\nImportantly, this action ensures that Cardano governance proceeds without interruption or ambiguity, as the current ICC’s term ends at Epoch 580. Delaying or rejecting this transition would risk a power vacuum and undermine months of community preparation and coordination.\n\nBy voting yes, we affirm the voice of the voters, safeguard constitutional governance, and help inaugurate a long-term, accountable Constitutional Committee formed through community consensus. It is both a procedural obligation and a proud milestone in Cardano’s Voltaire era, and we wish the best of luck to the new CC.\n"
