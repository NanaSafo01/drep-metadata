    "comment": "We, the Wada DRep, have voted yes on the “Cardano GovTool Budget – 12 Months Full Active Maintenance and Development” proposal. Our support for this request is based on two core principles: governance maturity and community value. This proposal represents a critical step forward in preserving open access to Cardano’s on-chain governance while also modeling how community-funded initiatives should engage, respond, and evolve based on input from stakeholders.\n\nThe GovTool team has demonstrated remarkable responsiveness to the feedback gathered from DReps, contributors, and the broader community during the 2025 budgeting process. After submitting their initial proposal, they undertook several rounds of consultations through the Governance Tool Working Group, community forums, and open development calls. As a result, the final proposal reflects thoughtful, community-aligned adjustments that meaningfully improve both its scope and its strategic value.\n\nOne of the most important improvements was the introduction of a tiered funding structure, Levels 1 through 3, which now makes the budget modular and transparent. This allows the community to understand what features and activities are funded at each level of support, from baseline infrastructure maintenance to full-featured active development and incentive programs. This structure reflects a realistic and scalable vision for public goods development under decentralized governance.\n\nBeyond the process, the features that GovTool will deliver under this proposal stand to benefit the Cardano community in tangible, far-reaching ways.\n\nGovTool is the primary open-source frontend for Cardano governance, already used by over 48,000 ADA holders across more than 170 countries, as hinted in the proposal. It powers vital governance actions, DRep registration, delegation, proposal creation, voting, and outcome tracking, and integrates with other public tools such as 1694.io, cardanobudget.com, and governancespace.co, etc. Continued investment in GovTool ensures that every ADA holder, not just the technically fluent, can participate meaningfully in Cardano’s governance era.\n\nThe proposal also strengthens the ecosystem by introducing and funding community incentive pools. These include ₳150K for contributors to the GovTool GitHub repository and ₳100K for developers building interoperable tools using GovTool APIs. This move expands the circle of contributors and helps grow a governance developer ecosystem that is open, competitive, and sustainable.\n\nMoreover, the team is committed to open APIs, quality assurance (QA), user experience testing, localization efforts, and enhanced support for wallet integrations and backend reliability. These improvements directly address pain points raised during the beta testing phase and will result in a more robust and user-friendly experience for everyone participating in on-chain governance.\n\nWe are also encouraged by the team’s adherence to constitutional best practices. The proposal is administered through Intersect, using milestone-based smart contracts, and includes refund clauses for unused funds. It complies with all relevant sections of the Cardano Constitution, particularly Articles IV.1 to IV.4.\n\nIn short, this proposal reflects not just a strong technical project but a governance-aware, community-integrated initiative that has developed through delivery, transparency, and collaboration. It keeps Cardano’s governance layer accessible, protects the neutrality of core infrastructure, and empowers new contributors to build and improve on shared foundations.\n\nFor all these reasons, its strategic importance, its transparent evolution based on community feedback, and the wide set of features it will deliver for ADA holders, we have voted yes and encourage others to support this essential proposal.\n"
