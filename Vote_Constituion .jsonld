    "comment": "Wada has been very instrumental in the constitutional process since day one because we have always wanted decision-making to shift to the community. From hosting educational workshops to ensure that community members understand governance principles, to facilitating town hall discussions where diverse voices could contribute to shaping the constitution, we have consistently championed inclusive decision-making. We also played a key role in providing translation services and culturally relevant explanations to ensure that non-technical participants fully grasped the implications of their choices. Given our contribution thus far, voting “No” or “Abstain” would be a direct counter to what we have always advocated for. For instance, rejecting the constitution at this stage could delay the transition to a decentralized governance model, undermining the very principles we have worked so hard to promote. Instead, by voting “Yes,” we reaffirm our commitment to community-led governance. We believe that whatever issues may arise—whether they involve interpretation of constitutional clauses, adjustments to governance structures, or improvements in decision-making processes—can be effectively handled by the collective expertise within the Cardano community, just as we have seen with previous collaborative efforts in governance-related discussions and problem-solving initiatives.
