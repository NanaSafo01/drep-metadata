    "comment": "We, the Wada DRep Committee, have voted NO on the Budget Info Governance Action titled “Tempo for Cardano Governance – Maintenance & Development Budget for 2025”. While we recognise the value of alternative governance interfaces and the importance of user-friendly mobile voting experiences, we found this proposal too vague and underdeveloped to earn our support at this stage of the process.\n\nAs a Budget Info Action, this proposal serves as a signal of community support or rejection for potential future Treasury disbursement. From that lens, it is vital that proposals demonstrate a clear plan, responsible budgeting, and public accountability, none of which are sufficiently evident here. While we do support the listed upgrade features, the proposal lacks basic structural elements we believe are necessary for a credible signal to proceed, including:\n1. A transparent budget breakdown with justification for the ₳380,000 request (especially ₳200,000 for infrastructure),\n2. A timeline of development milestones,\n3. Public details about the development team or maintainers,\n4. Defined success criteria or measurable impact projections.\n5. Roadmap to open-sourcing the project and updating already existing features like demographic representation, etc.\n\nAdditionally, while Selfdriven is named as the administrative entity, there is no description of how treasury funds would be governed if this Budget Info Action were to lead to a Treasury Withdrawal. This raises concerns about execution oversight and the stewardship of public funds.\n\nGiven our DRep responsibility to help shape a high-trust, effective governance funding system, we cannot support proposals that fail to meet the basic standards of clarity, feasibility, and community accountability. Although we recognise the potential of Tempo.Vote and are open to supporting its future iterations, we encourage the proposers to return with a more robust, well-documented submission that the community can confidently evaluate.\n\nAccordingly, we have voted NO on this Budget Info Governance Action.\n"
