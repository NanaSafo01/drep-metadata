    "comment": "The proposed Net Change Limit (NCL) of 300 million ADA for 2025 and 250 million ADA for 2026 reflects a prudent approach to managing Cardano’s fiscal policies, which is essential for ensuring the long-term sustainability and development of the blockchain. Given the treasury inflows of approximately 345 million ADA in 2024, with projections indicating a 300 million ADA inflow for 2025, it is sensible to adopt a conservative spending limit that aligns with these figures.\n\nSetting a lower NCL than the total expected inflow allows us to preserve a portion of the treasury’s resources, specifically 44 million ADA in 2025 and 50 million ADA in 2026. This savings approach is not merely about withholding funds but rather about fostering a culture of prioritized and responsible spending. It ensures that funds are available for critical projects that enhance Cardano’s infrastructure and capabilities, thus positioning it as a leading blockchain technology.\n\nMoreover, establishing such fiscal constraints encourages a more strategic allocation of resources. It compels project proponents and the community to prioritize initiatives with the highest potential impact and value for the Cardano ecosystem. This is particularly pertinent in light of the current budget draft by Intersect, which demands a significant portion of the NCL—265M. By advocating for a reduction in Intersect’s budget to a level that maintains operational efficacy while freeing up funds for other valuable community projects, we promote a balanced and inclusive fiscal environment.\n\nAs a conservative delegate representative, we believe this proposal serves the best interest of the community. It balances the need for robust development and innovation with the imperative of maintaining a healthy fiscal reserve. This approach not only supports ongoing and future technological advancements but also upholds the integrity and stability of the Cardano treasury. This proposal, therefore, is not just about setting limits; it's about ensuring that every ADA spent is an investment into the secure, sustainable, and strategic growth of Cardano, making it the most robust blockchain platform for years to come.\n"
