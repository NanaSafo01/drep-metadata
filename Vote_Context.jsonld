I stressed less to provide any meaningful rationale for this vote, as I know very well that the outcome would not affect any parameters. However, the proposal is technically interesting and provides a clear foresight into what to expect post chang 2 and very much interested in prepping myself as a DRep for the activities ahead as an organisation with a common will to ensure inclusivity from the community that delegates to me."
