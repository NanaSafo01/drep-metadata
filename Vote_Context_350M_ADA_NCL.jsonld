    "comment": "Our decision to vote in favor of setting the Cardano 2025 Net Change Limit (NCL) at 350 million ADA is rooted in a thorough understanding of the necessity for a clearly defined NCL prior to evaluating budget proposals. Initially, we endorsed an NCL of 300 million ADA for the year 2025, acknowledging it as a suitable threshold given our conservative approach as a DRep. However, the influx of community proposals received through the transparent and open budgetary process has prompted the need to re-evaluate this limit.\n\nThe original budget drafted by Intersect was approximately 265 million ADA. Based on current trends and the dynamic nature of community involvement, we anticipate a significant increase in this figure once all community proposals are reviewed and potentially approved by DReps. Should this occur, the initially proposed NCL would be swiftly reached, utilizing the available 35 million ADA margin and leaving no flexibility for unforeseen expenditures or emergent projects. This situation necessitates an adjustment of the NCL by an additional 50 million ADA. Such an adjustment not only accommodates the burgeoning demand from initiatives like the Intersect Budget process but also ensures that there is room for new and unforeseen community submissions.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge the fiscal implications of this adjustment. Ordinarily, increasing the NCL would result in a projected deficit of 5 million ADA, considering the total treasury inflow amounted to 345 million ADA in 2024. This acknowledges a shortfall but reflects a strategic decision to prioritize community-driven development and engagement. To address this, it is imperative that we manage our finances with the utmost diligence going forward. Our actions must aim to ensure that the 5 million ADA deficit is responsibly offset and not further exacerbated. This commitment to financial stewardship will be vital in maintaining the long-term sustainability and fiscal health of the treasury, thereby supporting the ongoing growth and innovation within the Cardano ecosystem.\n"
