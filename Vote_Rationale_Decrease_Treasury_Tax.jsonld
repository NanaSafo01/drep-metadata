    "comment": "Reducing the treasury cut from 20% to 10% effectively halves the rate at which funds accumulate for future development, community initiatives, and unforeseen challenges. Although the treasury’s current balance is significant; almost ₳1.7Bn, longer-term implications warrant caution. Projected annual budgets of ₳200M+ could rapidly deplete reserves, especially in volatile market conditions. While prioritizing spending is prudent, it becomes much harder to fund simultaneous, large-scale initiatives as cutting the treasury inflow by half essentially forces the ecosystem to operate under tighter budget constraints at about ₳130M+. This can create bottlenecks or lengthier development timelines if the treasury cannot sustain multiple high-impact projects. Because the financial impact is substantial, prudence dictates that decisions be made only when we have both robust evidence of the benefits and a well-defined risk mitigation strategy.\n\nThe proposal’s main benefit, an estimated increase in staking rewards from around 4% to roughly 4.5% APY, may not meaningfully boost overall staking participation. Historical data across different blockchain ecosystems suggests that moderate APY increases often have only marginal effects on delegation behavior. In particular, large holders may see the biggest benefit, while smaller stakers and network security overall may see negligible change. In a large, mature ecosystem like Cardano, it is unclear whether this slight incentive bump justifies the resulting halved treasury inflow.\n\nUnder Appendix I, Section 2, Clause 6 of the Cardano Constitution, it is explicitly required that each parameter change be accompanied by a “specific reversion/recovery plan,” detailing how to restore a prior or similar configuration if “the overall effect on performance, security, or functionality is unacceptable.” The proposal to halve the treasury tax does not supply a clear fallback strategy. As a conservative DRep, we emphasize proper process: merely presuming a reversion to 20% if difficulties emerge does not fulfill the Constitution’s “must be produced” requirement. Because adherence to constitutional guidelines is crucial, a change of this scope should not advance without a documented contingency procedure. This same clause of Appendix I, Section 2, also highlights monitoring the “overall effect on performance, security, or functionality.” Reducing treasury inflows drastically, without a swift and defined way to revert if adverse effects like underfunded development or impaired network operations arise, could undermine Cardano’s capacity to address future challenges and needs.\n\nGiven that Cardano has only recently adopted its new governance framework with updated constitutional guardrails, we believe it is more prudent to see how well these structures manage existing priorities and funding for at least 12 months. Such a monitoring period would yield real-world data on treasury inflows, budgets, and stakeholder behavior. If the governance framework proves stable, a future treasury tax adjustment; one that includes the required reversion plan, key milestones, and review phases, could be introduced more safely. Even then, a narrower incremental reduction (for example, starting at 5%) or a staged approach would respect constitutional requirements and generate evidence on whether even a modest cut actually improves staking participation without undermining treasury sustainability.\n\nFor these reasons, we vote “No” on the current proposal to reduce the treasury tax from 20% to 10%. By adhering strictly to both the letter and spirit of our constitutional framework, we safeguard the network’s long-term vitality and the welfare of all its participants.\n"
